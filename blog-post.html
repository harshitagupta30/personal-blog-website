                    The palace of winds or the Hawa Mahal, is one of the most recognized landmarks of Jaipur. Smack in the center of the city, the Hawa Mahal is the quite populary described as a bee-hive structure. At the first sight of it, a heritage buff like me, just
                    stopped walking and skipped not one but many heart beats.

                    The palace is made up of pink and red-colored stone which makes the whole structure so impressive and beautiful. It was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh and was designed by an architect Ustad Lal Chand.

                <blockquote>
                    The primary reason to build this was to give the royal ladies a space to enjoy the city processions without being seen A screen to hide them and let them observe Purdah. This palace was not a place for them to stay, but merely, have some fun and enjoy
                    festivals.
                </blockquote>

                    Hawa Mahal is one of the top most things to see in Jaipur. I know that the outside is mesmerizing but you must visit the insides too.
